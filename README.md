# DysRegNet benchmarking scripts
Here we store implementation of [LIONESS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004219300872) and [SSN](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/44/22/e164/2691334)  method that we used in our manuscript: [DysRegNet: Patient-specific and confounder-aware dysregulated network inference](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.29.490015). 

 All scripts can be run from command line:
  ```bash
 python run_ssn.py
 
 ```
 or 
 
 ```bash
 python run_lioness.py
 
 ```
 
 Default locations for the example data are in the `test` folder. To access the full list of arguments please add `-h` arguments. For example:
 ```bash
 python run_ssn.py -h
 
 ```
